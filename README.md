## Rideshare User Data Analysis
This project takes historical data from a bicycle rideshare company in Chicago, IL, and conducts an exploratory data analysis to identify trends in user behavior. Using Excel, I extracted user data from the previous year and cleaned it to remove outliers and null values and create latitude and longitude points for mapping. I then uploaded the .csv to R for further exploration.

### Project Scope
This project is meant to mirror the workflow of a data analyst in collaboration with the marketing team. The insights into user behavior can be used to inform marketing decisions that are aimed to increase user retention and target marketing towards users based on their interaction with the rideshare services.

### Tools Used
- Excel
- R
- Tableau
